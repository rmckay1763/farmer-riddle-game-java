A farmer must get a fox, chicken, and sack of grain safely across a river 
from the west bank to the east bank. The farmer's boat can only carry one
item at a time along with the farmer. Unfortunately, if the farmer leaves 
the fox and chicken together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the  farmer 
leaves the chicken and the grain together, the chicken will eat the grain. 
How can the farmer get all items safeley across the river?
